 # TODO
 ## General
 - [ ] Use Neural Network for classifying
 - [ ] Use our classifier more in dialog_flow.py
 - [ ] Perform a system comparison (which one is better? why? ) from multiple perspectives (accuracy, robustness, interpretability etc. ). 
 - [ ] Evaluate the results better (i.e. other metrics other than accuracy). 
 
 ## Configurability
 - [ ] Levenshtein edit distance for preference extraction
 - [ ]     Ask user about correctness of match for Levenshtein results
 - [ ]    Allow preferences to be stated in random order or not
 - [ ]     Allow preferences to be stated in a single utterance only, or in multiple utterances with one preference per utterance only, or without restrictions (any     number of utterances and any number of preferences per utterance)
 - [ ]    Use your baseline for dialog act recognition instead of the machine learning classifier
 - [ ]    Insert artificial errors in preference extraction
 - [ ]    Start offering suggestions after the first preference type is recognized vs. wait until all preference types are recognized
 - [ ]    Use formal or informal phrases in system utterances
 - [ ]     Allow dialog restarts or not
 - [ ]     Introduce a delay before showing system responses
 - [ ]     Always offer a small or large number of recommendations
 - [ ]     Ask confirmation for each preference or not
 - [ ]     Allow users to change their preferences or not
 - [ ]     OUTPUT IN ALL CAPS OR NOT
 - [ ]     Use text-to-speech for system utterances
 - [ ]     Any other modification of the state transition diagram you consider interesting for user testing
